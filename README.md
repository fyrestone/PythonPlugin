Introduction
--


This OBS Plugin wraps the OBSApi in Python and provides an embedded Python environment for development of custom Python sources.

This allows you to create custom sources using easily editable Python scripts.

This project is a fork of https://github.com/TheAndyRoid/PythonPlugin, and brings certain improvements:


- Checkout and compile with Visual Studio 2013 directly, no other dependencies. 
- Easy copy/paste installation, integrated with Python and other necessary libraries.
- Fix some bugs in ExampleScripts.

But, this project is not completed yet, for example, missing AudioSource Python wrapper. It is written by pure Python C API, the pro: it's a good example to show how to write a Python Wrapper, the con: there is no [boost::python](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html) magic thus no power to make the Python wrapper neat and clean.
